# Good Day Fishing
an Ascii Fishing Game
by Jean Park
2016

This is a fishing game project that I made in memory of the good times I had as a child.
Presented to my CS210 Data Structures class in Spring 2016.


Special Thanks to Kasra Ferdowsifard for the generous help with the projector and laptop that day.

##Build:

Compile the all the source files and then make sure to have the player assets 
(boating-left.txt, boating-right.txt, fishing-left.txt, fishing-right.txt) 
in the same folder as the .exe file.

##Gameplay:

  Fish to your heart's content while dodging birds trying to ruin your day.
  
##Controls:

  **Esc** - quits program  
  **Arrow keys** - dependent on what you're character is doing:  
  
  
  You start in Boating mode which lets you move left and right.
  + Pressing down once makes you sit.   
  + Pressing down again lets you fish.
  
Once you're fishing, you can reel your line one time by pressing up.   


Hitting the bottom of the ocean will also reel your line.  


##Adjustable values:  
The spawn rate and world size are adjustable within the source code.  


###To Do:  
+ Include a compiled executable ready to play 
+ Organize source and assets into their own folders.  
+ Recheck segs.
