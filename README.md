# Good Day Fishing
an Ascii Fishing Game

2016

This is a fishing game that I made in memory of the good times I had as a child.

##Build:

Just compile the all the source files, and then make sure to have the player assets 
(boating-left.txt, boating-right.txt, fishing-left.txt, fishing-right.txt) 
in the same foler as the .exe file.

##Gameplay:

  Fish to your heart's content while dodging birds trying to ruin your day.
  
##Controls:

  *Esc* - quits program
  Everything else is done with arrow keys, dependent on what you're character is doing:
  
  You start in Boating mode which lets you move left and right.
    * Pressing down once makes you sit. 
    * Pressing down again lets you fish.
  
  Once you're fishing, you can reel your line one time by pressing up.  
  Hitting the bottom of the ocean will also reel your line.

##Adjustable values:
The spawn rate and world size are adjustable within the source code.

###To Do:
Organize source and assets into their own folders.
Check segs again
Include a compiled executable ready to play
