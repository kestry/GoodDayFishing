Reasons for ";" error or linking errors:
#include
:: scope
include inline in hpp
delete inlilne in cpp
exclude/include hpp/cpp file
erase {
wrong return type from copying

Questions:
Does implementing an object to a heap that has objects implemented on the heap have any downsides?
Also, is it then better to implement on the stack and then have the overall system implement the items on the heap?

Game.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: void __thiscall Player::drawPoopMessage(class World &)" 
(?drawPoopMessage@Player@@QAEXAAVWorld@@@Z) referenced in function "private: void __thiscall Game::handlePoopHeadCollision(void)"

solution: delete inline in cpp file
