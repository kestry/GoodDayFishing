# Good Day Fishing
######an ASCII Fishing Game
######by Jean Park, 2016

This is my CS210 Data Structures project written in memory of the good times I had as a child.
Presented to the class in Spring 2016.  

Special Thanks to Kasra Ferdowsifard for the generous help with the projector and laptop that day.
And a shoutout to our 2015 team ByteSized with Sam Hutcher!! Woo!

##Build:

Compile all the source files and then make sure to have the player assets 
(boating-left.txt, boating-right.txt, fishing-left.txt, fishing-right.txt) 
in the same folder as the .exe file.


Or go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxEoycu0MQ7wZFloblptbFNOTVk "Google Drive - GoodDayFishing") and download the .exe and .txt files into the same folder to play the game.

##Gameplay:

  Fish to your heart's content while dodging birds trying to ruin your day.
  
##Controls:

  **Esc** - quits program  
  **Arrow keys** - dependent on what you're character is doing:  
  
  
  You start in Boating mode which lets you move left and right.
  + Pressing down once makes you sit.   
  + Pressing down again lets you fish.
  
Once you're fishing, you can reel your line a single time by pressing up.   


Hitting the bottom of the ocean will also reel your line.  


##Adjustable values:  
The spawn rate and world size are adjustable within the source code.

###To Do:  
+ Include a compiled executable in GitHub
+ Organize source and assets into their own folders.  
+ Recheck segs.
