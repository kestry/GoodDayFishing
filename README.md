# Good Day Fishing
an Ascii Fishing Game
by Jean Park
2016

This is a fishing game that I made in memory of the good times I had as a child.

Build:

Just compile the all the source files, and then make sure to have the player assets 
(boating-left.txt, boating-right.txt, fishing-left.txt, fishing-right.txt) 
in the same foler as the .exe file.

Gameplay:

  Fish to your heart's content while dodging birds trying to ruin your day.
  
  Esc to exit
  
  ArrowKeys:
    left and right to move boat
    down and up to sit and stand
    down and up to cast and reel (once you're sitting)

The spawn rate and world size are adjustable within the source code.

To Do:
Organize source and assets into their own folders.
Check segs again
