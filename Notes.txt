PoopHeadCollision and FishHookCollision:
- seems sketchy because of my fake boat physics but no physics calculation for the collision

Consolidating Ticks
- some kind of tick class/system?
- at least a function?

WishList:
- split Sprite into 1D and 2D classes with inheritance
- dealing with strings instead of sprites
- colors
